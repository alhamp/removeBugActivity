<h>Remove the BugBear!</h>
<h2>There is a BugBear in your home and it is ruining your life!</h>
    <p>
        You would like to destroy it completely, but due to some life changes you became vegan and no longer have the desire to kill any living creature. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, you will just release it into the wild where it can be removed from this planet naturally by some other predator.
    </p>

<img id="myImage" onclick="changeImage()" src="closedBug.png">

<h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>You want to find and fix all the "bugs" in this project so an image of a BugBear will be shown inside the house (behind a closed door). 
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be able to click the door and release the BugBear into the wild. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also be able to click the door again to close it (trapping the BugBear again inside your home).
    </p>
